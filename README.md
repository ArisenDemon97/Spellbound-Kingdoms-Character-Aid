# Spellbound-Kingdoms-Character-Aid
A character creation and use aid for the TTRPG Spellbound Kingdoms. (If I'm asked to take it down, I will)

This is a free and open-source app that I'm working on (I've only just really started, so it's not very complete yet) to help with the creation, tracking, and use of, Spellbound Kingdoms characters. The TTRPG itself is made by Frank Brunner, and he owns all rights, I'm making this of my own volition, and if there is any problem with this at all, I will take it down.

As of this moment, it's being made with SDL2.0, and is in such an early state, that it will essentially do nothing at this particular moment. If you want to see any actual results, come back later, once I've finished making a main menu as well as making the first feature.
