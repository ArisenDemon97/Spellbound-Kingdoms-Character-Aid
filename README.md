# Spellbound-Kingdoms-Character-Aid
A character creation and use aid for the TTRPG Spellbound Kingdoms. (If I'm asked to take it down, I will)

This is a free and open-source app that I'm working on (I've only just really started, so it's not very complete yet) to help with the creation, tracking, and use of, Spellbound Kingdoms characters. The TTRPG itself is made by Frank Brunner, and he owns all rights, I'm making this of my own volition, and if there is any problem with this at all, I will take it down.

As of this moment, it's being made with SDL2.0, and is in such an early state, that it will essentially do nothing at this particular moment. If you want to see any actual results, come back later, once I've finished making the first features.



Current build: Loads up a black screen with a red bar on the right, as well as some menu options. May not compile properly without creating an images folder (in the same directory as the cpp file) and putting a picture named MainMenu.bmp into said folder.
I have my own image that I'm using as the main menu, but seeing as it's art from the official Spellbound Kingdoms pdf, I will not be uploading it along with the rest of the source code (For those interested, and that have the pdf, check page 5, just before it starts Chapter One. It should be an image of several people rappelling on a castle wall).

Overall it SHOULD be cross-platform, seeing as I'm using SDL2, but I'm not entirely certain about this. If you want to test it for me as I develop it, and tell me what's going on, or make suggestions to improve the portability, I'd appreciate it.

Finally, thank you for checking out my app. I hope it ends up being useful to lots of people!

NOTE: I took a short hiatus from developing this, but I'm still going to be developing it, starting with refactoring it to implement OOP design. As it is, it'll work, but it'll be a mess to work on/with. Once I've finished refactoring it, it should work the same, but be easier to develop.
